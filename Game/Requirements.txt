	c. The time-limit for the finding the word can be configured in the menu but is set to 60 seconds by default.

14. New game-mode: Don’t make a word

	b. Players must not form a word longer than two letters in any of the directions specified in rule 6.
	c. A player loses when they form a word longer than two letters while placing their assigned letter.
	d. The game ends when only one player remains (the winner) or when there is no more room for letters on the board (remaining players are then shared winners).
15. Add a way for players to define and load new scrabble-boards with either pre-placed or randomised scrabble-tiles.
16. Add support for additional languages (in addition to English), including dictionary and letter-points configurations.

Additional requirements (in addition to rules 1-17)
18. It should be easy to modify and extend your software (modifiability and extensibility quality attributes). It is to support future modifications such as the ones proposed in the “future modifications to the game” section (you don’t need to implement these unless you want to, just structure the architecture so it is easy to do in the future. Though implementing some of the future modifications may help you see whether your updated structure is good or not).
19. It should be easy to test, and to some extent debug, your software (testability quality attribute). This is to be able to test the game rules as well as different phases of the game-play.
